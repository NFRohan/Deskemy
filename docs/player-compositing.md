# Player compositing (C1) — killing airspace

Branch: `player-compositing`. Goal: composite mpv's video **into the same surface
as the WebView** so DOM and video resize atomically — eliminating the airspace
lag/bounce for good, and (bonus) unlocking real overlays over the video.

Status legend: ☐ todo · ◐ in progress · ☑ done · ✗ blocked

> **Status (1.0.x):** the compositing path is now the **default on Windows**, not

> video always works. `DESKEMY_COMPOSITOR=0` forces wid; `=1`/any value forces

## Why we're here

Today mpv renders into a `STATIC` **child HWND** (`--wid`) that we raise above
the WebView2 sibling (`move_child` → `HWND_TOP`, see `player/mod.rs`). Two
separate surfaces (WebView2's HWND + mpv's HWND) that the OS never composites
together, so their resizes can't be atomic:

- WebView pane resizes on the GPU compositor instantly.
- mpv HWND is repositioned via JS → IPC → main thread → `SetWindowPos`, 1–2+
  frames behind → the video visibly chases/bounces on fullscreen + panel toggles.

Mitigations tried and rejected: auto-hide reflow (rubberband), hide-during-resize
mask (whole-video blackout — "infinitely worse"). The root fix is to stop having
two surfaces.

## Target architecture (C1)

```
        ┌─ main window (transparent, DWM per-pixel alpha) ─┐
        │  DComp visual tree:                              │
        │    [top]    WebView2  (transparent bg)           │  ← DOM / controls
        │    [below]  mpv video (D3D11 texture)            │  ← composited, not a HWND
        └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- mpv uses the **render API** (`mpv_render_context`, OpenGL via ANGLE→D3D11, or
  software→texture) to render into a **D3D11 texture we own** instead of a HWND.
- That texture is the content of a **DirectComposition visual** placed **beneath**
  the WebView2, on the same window. The page is transparent where the video shows.
- Both are composited by DWM/DirectComposition → resize is one atomic operation.
  No `SetWindowPos` race, no bounce. The video pane in the DOM just needs a
  transparent hole; the compositor keeps the video glued to it.

## Stack facts (recon)

- tauri **2.11.5**, wry **0.55.1**, webview2-com **0.38.2**, `windows` **0.61.3**
  (already transitively present — add as direct dep with DComp/D3D11/DXGI feats).
- Window: `decorations:false`, not currently `transparent`.
- Tauri `WebviewWindow::with_webview(|w| …)` → on Windows exposes
  `w.controller()` (`ICoreWebView2Controller`) and the HWND. Enough to set the
  transparent background color; **not** enough to switch hosting mode.
- mpv wrapper is runtime FFI via `libloading` (`mpv/mod.rs`) — render-API symbols
  are just more symbols to load. Current child-window code is
  `create_child`/`move_child`/`show_child` in `player/mod.rs` (Windows cfg).

## THE gating unknown

wry hosts WebView2 **windowed** (child HWND), not **visual/composition** hosting.
Visual hosting (`CreateCoreWebView2CompositionController`) is the canonical way to
layer WebView2 with other DComp content — and wry doesn't do it.

**Q: will a DComp visual on the parent HWND show through a transparent windowed
WebView2?**
- If **yes** → C1 works entirely in our code. 🎉
- If **no** → we need visual hosting = patch/fork wry (`[patch.crates-io]`) or
  host our own WebView2 for the player window. Big scope jump → stop and re-decide.

We answer this with a **dumb solid-color layer** before any mpv work.

## Phased plan (each phase is a testable gate)

### Phase 1 — Compositing feasibility spike  ☑ **GATE PASSED (2026-07-14)**
Proved a composited layer shows through the WebView, no mpv involved.
- ☑ `windows` crate dep (DirectComposition, Direct3D11, Dxgi).
- ☑ `transparent: true` on the window — opaque UI still looks normal.
- ☑ `compositor.rs`: D3D11 device → composition swapchain (magenta) →
  `DCompositionCreateDevice` → `CreateTargetForHwnd` → visual → commit. Behind the
  `compositor_test` command; dev trigger Ctrl+Shift+G (makes page transparent).
- ☑ **RESULT: magenta shows through the transparent windowed WebView2.**
  → **C1 is viable entirely in our own code — NO wry fork needed.** Sidebar/topbar
  (opaque) stayed on top; the transparent rest showed the desktop. Swapchain-for-
  composition + `IDCompositionVisual::SetContent(swapchain)` is the content path
  we'll reuse for mpv.
- Note: the transparent-region "background" is just whatever's behind the window
  (test punches the *whole* page). In prod only the video pane is a hole, filled
  opaquely by the mpv texture (incl. black letterbox), so nothing peeks through.

### Phase 2 — mpv render context → texture  ☐
Now unblocked (Phase 1 passed). **De-risk with the software render path first** —
it proves the whole pipeline end-to-end with none of the GL/D3D interop risk, and
for a course player (slides/talking-heads) may even be good enough to ship.
- ☐ Load render-API symbols in `mpv/mod.rs`: `mpv_render_context_create`,
  `mpv_render_context_render`, `mpv_render_context_set_update_callback`,
  `mpv_render_context_free`, `mpv_render_context_report_swap`.
- ☐ **2a (software, first):** create the render context with
  `MPV_RENDER_API_TYPE_SW`. Each frame: give mpv a CPU buffer (`sw_size`,
  `sw_format`=`0bgr`/`rgba`, `sw_stride`, `sw_pointer`); `UpdateSubresource` it
  into a D3D11 texture that backs the composition swapchain; `Present`. Drive off
  the update callback + a paint tick. Retire `--wid`; mpv owns no window.
- ☐ **2b (GPU, optimize later):** swap SW for OpenGL via **ANGLE** (WebView2 ships
  `libEGL`/`libGLESv2`), rendering into an EGL-wrapped D3D11 texture — no CPU
  readback. Only if SW perf/power isn't acceptable.
- ☐ Position/size the DComp visual from the pane rect. Resize is now atomic; the
  JS still reports the rect but it only moves a compositor visual.

### Phase 3 — Wire texture → DComp visual  ☐
- ☐ Feed the mpv texture as the DComp visual content (swapchain or surface).
- ☐ Replace the child-HWND path: retire `create_child`/`move_child`; mpv no
  longer owns a window. Keep the old path behind a config flag until stable.
- ☐ Position/size the visual from the pane rect (still reported from JS, but now
  it only moves a compositor visual — cheap and can be made atomic).

### Phase 4 — Parity + cleanup  ☐
- ☐ Subtitles, letterbox bg, aspect, HDR/hwdec sanity, multi-monitor DPI.
- ☐ Resize is atomic → delete the reportRect delays, the fullscreen fill hacks,
  and revisit whether controls can now *overlay* the video (airspace gone).
- ☐ Linux path (separate: GL/EGL + a wayland/x11 subsurface or the same render
  API into a GtkGLArea) or keep `wid` embedding on Linux behind cfg.
- ☐ Perf: no extra copies, vsync, power use.

## Fallbacks (if Phase 1 gate fails)

1. **Patch wry for composition hosting** — `[patch.crates-io.wry]` → our fork that
   creates the WebView2 via `CreateCoreWebView2CompositionController` and hands us
   the visual to parent under. Known-good, but a fork to maintain.
2. **Two-window** — transparent WebView window + a video window behind, both moved
   from one Rust resize handler. Sidesteps in-window layering; adds two-window
   focus/z-order/sync fiddliness. Not really "one surface."
3. **Abandon C1, ship B1+A1** — Rust-driven `WindowEvent::Resized` reposition +
   instant (un-animated) panels. ~95% of the win for ~5% of the effort. The
   pragmatic retreat.

## Guardrails

- ~~Keep the working `wid` player as the default until the new path reaches parity;
  gate the compositor behind a flag.~~ **Superseded (1.0.x):** compositor is now
  default-on, but *probe-gated with an automatic `wid` fallback* (see the Status
  note at the top) — so the guarantee "never ship a broken player" is preserved by
  the fallback rather than by keeping wid the default.
- Windows-first. Linux stays on `wid` behind cfg until Phase 4.
- Each phase must build green and be user-testable in isolation.
